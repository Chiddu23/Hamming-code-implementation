# Hamming-code-implementation
A Hamming code implementation project typically involves the development of a computer program or circuit that can encode and decode data using Hamming error-correcting codes.

**Server Side:**

- The server side is responsible for listening to incoming client connections and performing the Hamming code simulation.
- It uses Java's ServerSocket and Socket classes to establish connections.
- The server receives a stream of bits from the client, simulates a random error, and then calculates the Hamming code for the data.
- It detects and corrects the error and sends the corrected data back to the client.

**Client Side:**

- The client side provides a graphical user interface for user interaction.
- Users can input a stream of bits, and the client simulates a random error in the input data.
- The client sends the data to the server, which calculates and corrects the Hamming code, and then returns the corrected data to the client.
- The corrected data, as well as information about the error position, is displayed to the user.

Key Features:

1. **Graphical User Interface**: The client-side offers a user-friendly interface for data input and result display.

2. **Hamming Code Simulation**: The project accurately simulates Hamming code encoding and decoding, along with error correction.

3. **Random Error Generation**: The client introduces a random error into the data, which allows users to see the error correction process.

4. **Client-Server Communication**: The project demonstrates socket-based communication between the client and the server.

5. **Java Programming**: The project is implemented in Java, making use of Java's standard libraries and network communication classes.

6. **Code Reversal**: The client reverses the order of the input data bits before sending them to the server, mimicking common practices in Hamming code encoding.

7. **Informative Output**: The project provides detailed information about the generated Hamming code, the error introduced, and the corrected code.

This project serves as an educational tool for understanding how Hamming codes work, from encoding to error detection and correction. It provides a hands-on experience of the concepts involved in error-correcting codes, making it a useful resource for those learning about data transmission and error handling in digital communication systems.
